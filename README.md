🖼️ KodaSnap System

KodaSnap is an interactive photo system that allows users to take pictures, add stickers, and generate a downloadable or printable final output. The system ensures accurate preview-to-final rendering, responsive layout, and smooth user experience across all devices.

🚀 Features

Responsive Design:
Automatically adjusts layout and elements for phones, tablets, and laptops. Ensures all content is visible on smaller screens with no overlapping or hidden parts.

Accurate Preview:
The photo in the final output appears exactly as it does during capture — no stretching or distortion.

Sticker Controls:

Stickers only appear after the user selects a design.

Five stickers are automatically placed around the image edges, randomly positioned but never covering the face or main photo area.

Stickers cannot go beyond the frame and are easy to control.

Users can select “No Sticker” to remove all stickers.

Timestamp Customization:
Users can change the timestamp color to ensure visibility regardless of background color.

GCash Payment Integration:
Includes a GCash QR code (visible and properly positioned) for easy scanning and payment on the payment page.

Download & Print Functionality:
Both buttons work properly, allowing users to save or print their photos directly.

Ensure all stickers, images, and timestamps remain within the frame boundaries.

Verify that the GCash QR code is visible and scannable.

Regularly test on mobile devices for layout accuracy.
